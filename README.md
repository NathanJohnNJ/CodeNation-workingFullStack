After cloning this repository, cd into the repo and then run ./install.sh - this will run ‘rpm I’ for both the front end and the back end.

Next create a .env file at root level and add the necessary information to link your database from clever-cloud.

Then run ./start.sh which will start the back end server and launch the front end React app.
